// Find the Bug: Returning the Container
// The packaging system is running wild! The candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse, the cereal is missing, and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.

// The packaging machine is running the getContainer() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...

// Examples
// getContainer("Bread") ➞ "bag"

// getContainer("Beer") ➞ "bottle"

// getContainer("Candy") ➞ "plastic"

// getContainer("Cheese") ➞ null
// Notes
// Think about what the object's packaging should be.
