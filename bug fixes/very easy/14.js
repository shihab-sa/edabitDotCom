// Fix the Broken Code
// A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function that sorts all the letters of a word, but their code is broken, and they can't figure out why.

// Spot and fix the error(s) in the code to make the function work.

// Examples
// sortWord("dcba") ➞ "abcd"

// sortWord("Unpredictable") ➞ "Uabcdeeilnprt"

// sortWord("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis") ➞ "aacccccceiiiiiilllmmnnnnooooooooopprrsssstuuv"
// Notes
// Input is a word.
