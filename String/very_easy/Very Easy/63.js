// Keyboard Mistakes
// Character recognition software often makes mistakes when documents (especially old ones written with a typewriter) are digitized.

// Your task is to correct the errors in the digitized text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

// A is misinterpreted as 4
// S is misinterpreted as 5
// O is misinterpreted as 0
// I is misinterpreted as 1
// The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

// Examples
// keyboardMistakes("MUB45H1R") ➞ "MUBASHIR"

// keyboardMistakes("DUBL1N") ➞ "DUBLIN"

// keyboardMistakes("51NG4P0RE") ➞ "SINGAPORE"
// Notes
// N/A
