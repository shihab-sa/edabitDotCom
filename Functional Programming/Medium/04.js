// Promises I: What Is a Closure?
// Closures are functions that remember their lexical environments. Lexical environments mean the environment in which the function was declared.

// function parent(x) {
//   return function closure() {    // Closure is declared here.
//     return x
//   }
// }

// const remember = parent("remembers me")
// // Seems like the variable x would be gone after
// // parent is executed, but it's not.

// closure()
// // Returns "remembers me" because the inner
// // function remembers x.
// Fix the greetingMaker() function so that it works with the greeting() function.
// The greeting() function has already been created (check the Tests tab).
// Example
// const greeting = greetingMaker("Hello")
// greeting("James") âžž "Hello, James"
// Notes
// Check the Resources tab for more info on closures.




function parent(x){
    return function closure(){
        return x 
    }
}

const remember = parent("remembers me") 
console.log(remember);
closure()
