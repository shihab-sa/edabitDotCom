// Arithmetic Progression
// In mathematics, an Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. Create a function that takes three arguments:

// First element of the sequence first
// Constant difference between the elements diff
// Total numbers in the sequence n
// Return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference diff. The final result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.

// Examples
// arithmeticProgression(1, 2, 5) ➞ "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"

// arithmeticProgression(1, 0, 5) ➞ "1, 1, 1, 1, 1"

// arithmeticProgression(1, -3, 10) ➞ "1, -2, -5, -8, -11, -14, -17, -20, -23, -26"
// Notes
// N/A
