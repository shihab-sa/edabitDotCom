// Hamming Distance
// Hamming distance is the number of characters that differ between two strings.

// To illustrate:

// String1: "abcbba"
// String2: "abcbda"

// Hamming Distance: 1 - "b" vs. "d" is the only difference.
// Create a function that computes the hamming distance between two strings.

// Examples
// hammingDistance("abcde", "bcdef") ➞ 5

// hammingDistance("abcde", "abcde") ➞ 0

// hammingDistance("strong", "strung") ➞ 1
// Notes
// Both strings will have the same length.

function hammingDistance() {}
